I had a chance to learn machine learning using tensorflow at work to provide useful information to our staffs and clients. At that time, I didn't have any knowledge about machine learning. A month has passed and I have learned basics of machine learning from books and online materials. I'm still a beginner to machine learning but already a fan of it. I like the fact that it can solve problems without me implenting the logic. The machine will figure it out.

My goal in the near future is to write many practical machine learnig codes useful to our company using **tensorflow** with **python3**. I will write things I learned from that journey.
